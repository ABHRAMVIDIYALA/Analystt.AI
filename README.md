I have written a Python script to scrape product data from Amazon India and fetch additional information from the product detail pages. The script utilizes the BeautifulSoup library for web scraping and the pandas library for exporting the data to a CSV file.
You can find the code and instructions on how to run it in the following GitHub repository: Python Amazon Scraper (https://github.com/ABHRAMVIDIYALA/Analystt.AI)
Please make sure to install the required packages listed in the requirements.txt file before running the script. Additionally, ensure that you have a stable internet connection and enough processing power to scrape a large number of pages.
The script scrapes at least 20 pages of product listing pages, extracting the product URL, product name, product price, rating, and number of reviews. It then visits each product URL to fetch additional information such as the description, ASIN, product description, and manufacturer. Finally, it exports all the collected data into a CSV file for further analysis.
Feel free to explore and modify the code as per your requirements. If you encounter any issues or have any questions, please let me know.
