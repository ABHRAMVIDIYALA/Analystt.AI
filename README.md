Subject: Completion of Python Assignment - Amazon Product Data Scraping
Dear Analystt.ai,
I am pleased to inform you that I have successfully completed the Python assignment you provided, which involved scraping product data from Amazon India and extracting additional information from the product detail pages. I would like to share the details of the assignment and provide you with the necessary deliverables.
Part 1:
For the initial part of the assignment, I have developed a Python script that utilizes the BeautifulSoup library for web scraping and the pandas library for exporting the data to a CSV file. The script is designed to scrape at least 20 pages of product listings from Amazon India and extract the following information for each product:
 • Product URL
 • Product Name
 • Product Price
 • Rating
 • Number of reviews
Part 2:
In the subsequent part of the assignment, the script leverages the product URLs obtained from Part 1 to navigate to each individual product's detail page. It then fetches additional information, including:
 • Description
 • ASIN
 • Product Description
 • Manufacturer
Deliverables:
To facilitate the review and utilization of the scraped data, I have provided a comprehensive solution in a GitHub repository. You can access the code and detailed instructions on how to run it by visiting the following link: Python Amazon Scraper (https://github.com/ABHRAMVIDIYALA/Analystt.AI)
To ensure smooth execution of the script, please make sure to install the required packages listed in the requirements.txt file before running it. Additionally, ensure that you have a stable internet connection and sufficient processing power to handle the scraping of a large number of pages.
The script has been thoroughly designed to scrape at least 20 pages of product listings, gathering a substantial amount of data for analysis. Furthermore, it successfully visits each product URL and retrieves additional information from the product detail pages, ensuring a comprehensive dataset.
Once the scraping process is complete, the script exports all the collected data into a CSV file. This file format allows for easy importation and analysis in various applications and software.
Please feel free to explore and modify the code as per your specific requirements. If you encounter any issues or have any questions, do not hesitate to reach out to me. I am available to provide any further assistance or address any concerns you may have.
Thank you for giving me the opportunity to showcase my skills through this assignment. I greatly appreciate your time and consideration.
Best regards,
ABHIRAM VIDIYALA.
